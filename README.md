A open-source stop-motion tool that runs on browsers. It allows you to shoot while tethring usb-connected cameras such as DSLMs, DSLRs, and webcams. Technically, it's bulit upon [Picture Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Transfer_Protocol), [WebUSB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB) and its wrapper library [Tethr](https://github.com/baku89/tethr). Note that this project has been developed for my own animation project and is still in early stage of working-in-progress. So it might not work in your environment yet.

FYI, Koma (コマ) means “frames” in Japanese, but I'm wondering if there's nicer name for the app.

## Development

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/baku89/koma
yarn install
yarn dev
```
